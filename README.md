# Music Generation with AI 🎵

This project implements an **AI-based Music Generation System** using **Deep Learning (LSTM networks)**.  
The model is trained on MIDI files to learn musical patterns and generate new music compositions automatically.

This project was developed as part of the **CodeAlpha Internship – Task 3**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Music generation is a challenging sequence-learning problem.  
In this project, **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural networks are used to learn temporal patterns from musical notes extracted from MIDI files.  
After training, the model generates a new sequence of notes and exports them as a playable MIDI file.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.10**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **music21**
- **NumPy**
- **Git & GitHub**

## ⚙️ How the System Works

1. **MIDI Preprocessing**
   - MIDI files are parsed using `music21`
   - Notes and chords are extracted and converted into sequences

2. **Model Training**
   - Sequences are fed into an LSTM-based neural network
   - The model learns musical patterns over time

3. **Music Generation**
   - The trained model predicts new note sequences
   - Generated notes are converted back into a MIDI file
